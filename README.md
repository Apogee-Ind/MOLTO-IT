# MOLTO-IT
**MOLTO-IT** (Multi-Objective Low-Thrust Optimizer for Interplanetary Trajectories) is a Matlab tool for the preliminary design of low-thrust, multi-gravity assist trajectories.
The software combines an outer loop that provides multi-objective optimization via a genetic algorithm with an inner loop that supplies gradient-based optimization of a shape-based low-thrust trajectory parameterization.
